# üöÄ Comparison of Features and Analysis of Use Cases: go-git vs go-github (Go Language)
## üßê Introduction

In Go language projects, we often need to operate Git repositories. In such cases, two mainstream libraries usually come into consideration:

### üîß What is go-git?

[`go-git`](https://github.com/go-git/go-git) is a Git operation library written in pure Go. It can implement full Git functionality, such as clone, checkout, commit, push, pull, etc., without the need to install the system Git.

**Applicable scenarios:**
- Local Git automation scripts.It can only operate on Git repositories on the local file system.
- CI/CD tool development
- Self-developed code platforms
- Embedded Git management (without relying on the system Git)

### üåê What is go-github?

[`go-github`](https://github.com/google/go-github) is an official GitHub API client maintained by Google, used to operate resources on the GitHub platform, such as repositories, Pull Requests, Issues, files, Actions, etc. It is based on GitHub's REST API at the underlying level.

**Applicable scenarios:**
- Development of GitHub-related tools
- Automated Issue/PR management
- Building ChatOps / Bot / platform docking tools
- Operating resources such as GitHub Actions, Webhooks, Tags, Releases

| File Operations        | ‚úÖ Read and write to the local file system                      | ‚úÖ Get/modify remote files (requires base64 encoding)             |
| Support for Pull/Push  | ‚úÖ Supported (with authentication)                              | ‚ùå Does not support Git protocol pull/push                        |
| Create PR              | ‚ùå Not supported (Git level does not involve platform logic)    | ‚úÖ Supports the complete PR creation, commenting, review, and merge process |
| Operate Issues         | ‚ùå Not supported                                                | ‚úÖ Supports operations such as creating, editing, and closing issues |
| GitHub Actions         | ‚ùå Not involved                                                 | ‚úÖ Can trigger/manage GitHub Actions workflows                    |
| Supported Repository Types | All Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, local, etc.)           | Only GitHub repositories                                         |
| Use Scenarios          | Local Git operations, CI/CD, embedded Git, automation scripts  | GitHub platform automation, remote collaboration, Bot, CI tools  |
| Dependency on Git Installation | ‚ùå Does not depend on the system Git                           | ‚ùå Does not depend on the system Git                             |
